                <h1>About</h1>
                <p>My name is Emem V. John. Writing taught me how to communicate and understand people.
                    Cloud engineering is teaching me how to understand systems and solve problems.
                    At Alt School Africa, I'm turning that learning into practice, exploring how technology creates real change.
                    I also run a small agency where storytelling and tools come together to support growth. I began with words. I'm building with code.

                <div class="hobby-item">
                    <h4>Curiosity and Games</h4>
                    <p>I explore words by listening to how people speak, discovering new expressions, and testing them in my writing.
                        Reading drives me, whether it is new books or classics, to understand how ideas are shaped.
                        Occasionally, I play strategy games to challenge my thinking and approach problems from different angles.</p>

                <div class="hobby-item">
                    <h4>Culinary Exploration</h4>
                    <p>I love crafting flavors, experimenting with ingredients, and discovering new ways to create meals.
                        Cooking is more than a skill; it is a way to understand culture, share experiences, and bring people together.
                        I enjoy testing ideas in the kitchen and finding inspiration from cuisines around the world.</p>

                    <h4>Digital Creativity</h4>
                    <p>Music has always been at the center of my creativity.
                        I write songs for independent artists and produce instrumentals that bring ideas to life.
                        I love using FL Studio and Logic Pro to craft beats and create musical magic.
                        While dance was once a big part of my expression, music remains constant.
                         Occasionally, I explore digital art and design, creating illustrations and mockups, but it is music that drives my creative journey.</p>

                <h3>Aspiration in life</h3>
                <div class="aspiration-content">
                    <h4>Tech Entrepreneur & Innovation Leader</h4>
                    <p>I chose to learn tech, because I see problems around me every day that shouldnâ€™t exist.
                        In Africa, access to simple tools, whether it is payments in foreign currencies, platforms for creators, or basic digital systems, is often harder than it should be.
                        My aspiration is to build technology that breaks those barriers and makes life easier for people who are often left out.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p style="margin-top: 15px;">I want to create solutions with real-life impact. My focus is on innovative, sustainable tools that address real challenges in Africa. 
                        These are tools that people can use, understand, and benefit from. My goal is to drive meaningful change across the continent while also designing solutions that can scale globally.
                    </p>

                    <p style="margin-top: 15px;">Along the way, I aim to grow as a developer and storyteller. I want to explore new ways to solve problems and share insights that matter. My work should inspire possibilities not just for developers, but for anyone trying to navigate tools and processes that were not built with them in mind.</p>
